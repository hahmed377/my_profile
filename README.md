# My Portfolio

## This will be a quick readme document so you can understand my profile page.

#### Firstly before starting any actual coding i used an application called mockflow as it would give me a template on how i wanted my Portfolio to look like on a desktop and what it looks like on a mobile device.

## Requirements
* Bootstrap
* Grid layout
* Mobile first
* Bootstrap Nav
* Google fonts
* Glyphs
* Github page
* User story
* wireframe

### Bootstrap

Using bootstrap it had made it easier to float items next to each other rather than using HTML. By using Bootstrap it had allow me to change and make it very easy to make the Portfolio responsive when on smaller devices.

### Grid layout



### Mobile first
When creating the portfolio page i had to make sure it was suitable for mobile devices before seeing if it was suitable to use on larger screen. By using bootstrap it allowed me to keep certain things hidden and keep only the most important information when on mobile device whilst on desktop screen all the information is displayed.

### Bootstrap Nav

Creating bootstrap navigation bar i had to import the stylesheet from the bootstrap website. By importing the stylesheets i could type in commands as bootstrap would already have it and i could just access it. The way the nav bar is designed is that when it is on desktop or larger screen it is displayed all across the top of the page but when it is on a mobile device the bar disappears and shows only a search button where the user can click on it would take him to certain parts of the page.

### Google fonts


### Glyphs
I had a couple of Glyphs on my Portfolio. I had one on the search bar where someone could click on and it would drop down the nav bar. I also had three along the contact me section, it was glyphs of email, github and linkedin. All of these were hyperlinked so it would take the user to the relevant sites to see more about me.
